<h1>Streaming learning Godot and Nakama</h1>
<p>After some years of not taking part on Ludum Dare, I did a very small project on the Saturday of the competition, creating a merge game using Rust and Comfy <a href="https://github.com/JosePedroDias/ld55">I called Merge or Die</a>.
I had watched a couple of Twitch streams in the day before, trying to get some
inspiration and thought I might stream my hackathon too, which <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jose_pedro_dias">I did</a>.</p>
<p>Weeks went by. I decided to try and <a href="https://github.com/JosePedroDias/merge_or_die">port my merge game to Godot 4</a> and it was pretty straightforward. Since I wanted to review my knowledge of
<a href="https://heroiclabs.com/nakama/">Nakama</a> as well, I thought of the simplest possible game I could program using Godot and, this time 3D. So I programmed a Game of Goose game. And I also streamed it.</p>
<p>I try not to worry too much about the quality of my streams - I must have been doing lots of rookie mistakes both in Godot and streaming. But so far, the commitment of logging my progress live seems to be helping me complete the ideas I propose myself to do.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the result of 13 1-2 hour sessions of work:</p>
